## More Info

Only a single game level is implemented so far.

I built this intending to show off the capabilities of my Tcell package for
Go (the library used for "terminal" graphics under the hood.)

I got kind of caught up in it, and now there is a pretty powerful game engine
under the hood.  There is full support for animated sprites, with collision
detection, layering, etc.  And I've made some pretty cool visual effects too.

It runs in a text window.  You want a reasonably big window (80x25 will work,
but its harder to play with smaller screens), and you'll want a fast display.

You'll also want a color terminal -- 256 color support in xterm or Terminal
is highly recommended.  Oh, and if you can, try to use a UTF-8 locale.  The
game will work in basic ASCII with black and white, and it isn't completely
garbage in that mode, but its *soo* much better with a more capable terminal.

Oh, don't try to run this over a 300 baud modem.  You won't be happy.

Local terminals work fine.  9600 baud is probably pushing it. I haven't
tested anything other than local connections; there are a lot of display
updates in the game, so you do want to have a reasonably fast display.
You can reduce the screen size if its too slow, that may help a little.

Yes, it should run in Windows too.

There is no sound (yet!)

Much of the code here will probably get cleaned up and structured properly
for reuse in nice library form.  Probably sub-packages under Tcell, for both
the dynamic views and probably also the sprite management code and maybe even
the full game loop.


## Reusing Code & Assets

If you want to reuse any of the code or assets here, feel free, per the
terms of the Apache 2 license.  I would however appreciate an email
letting me know how you're using this stuff -- I'm really hopeful that
this work will inspire new creative efforts by others and I'm anxious
to see what you create!

There are no special requirements to do so, but if you do use this code,
I'd appreciate a mention somewhere in your project, with a link back to
this github repo.

## Final note

This game is a work in progress and is probably of little actual playable value other than as a novelty.
